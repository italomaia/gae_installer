Easy to use google app engine installer. = D

## How to Use
Very simple: python gae_install.py

Make sure gae_install is executed with write permissions for /usr/bin/ and /opt/

## Further Work
I plan to make an uninstall script and support for appengine version lookup (if proven useful).

**ps** I'm not responsible for any problems that occur during from this script execution.
